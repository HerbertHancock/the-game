<p>What will you do now?</p>
    <p>ITS HIGH NOON! You have entered the wild west! The room is overwhelmingly hot and the dust is heavy in the air. You shade your eyes from the hot sun and in the distance you see 3 of each. A horse, a taxidermy animal head, and 3 different cowboy hats. Choose 1 of each to continue your adventure. </p>
